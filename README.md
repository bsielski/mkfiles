## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## The yaml file

The path to this file must be passed as an argument for the script. It contains the path for a root directory (for example "." for current dirrectory) and paths for all entries (directories, subdirectories and empty files) that will be created.

Start place and sub paths can be relative or absolute.

Sub paths for directories and subdirectories must ended with "/".

Use "/" as the directory separator.

An example of yaml file

```
start_place: "."

sub_paths:
  - random_directory_341234213/
  - ewqrfsd.txt
  - vdfewre/fwewfevc.txt
  - qewasdsdf/sd23e2fv/wfe32gv/d322fvgd/
  - qewasdsdf/sd23e2fv/dwqqwdqwef/
  - New Folderr53453/New Folder44444574/new document63452.txt
```
